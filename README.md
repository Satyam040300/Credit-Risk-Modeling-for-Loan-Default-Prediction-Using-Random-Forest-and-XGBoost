# Loan Default Prediction Using XGBoost and SMOTE

## üìÑ Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict loan defaults using a dataset of borrower attributes. The model is built with **XGBoost**, a gradient boosting algorithm, and addresses class imbalance through **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). 

The final model achieves **99% accuracy** and an **ROC-AUC score of 0.999**, making it a powerful tool for **credit risk assessment** and **lending decisions**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **XGBoost Model:** Optimized with hyperparameter tuning for maximum predictive performance.
- **SMOTE for Class Imbalance:** Balances the dataset to improve default detection.
- **Performance Metrics:** Classification report, accuracy, ROC-AUC score.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifies key factors influencing loan defaults.

## üìä Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 99%
- **ROC-AUC Score:** 0.999
- **Precision (Class 1):** 88%
- **Recall (Class 1):** 97%

## üìå Conclusion
This machine learning model can be applied by financial institutions to make more accurate predictions regarding loan defaults, helping optimize lending decisions and manage credit risk effectively.
